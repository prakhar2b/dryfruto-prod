npm@10.8.2 /usr/lib/node_modules/npm and creating a pre-built frontend package.
    -   Created and later removed multiple deployment guides and Docker configurations as per user request, leaving only a .
-   **Bug Fixes (DONE):**
    -   Fixed a critical issue where newly created pages appeared blank due to incorrect component paths and a webpack caching bug.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend Build:** The React app is pre-built using . The resulting static files in  are intended to be served by a web server like Nginx, which avoids the need for a Node.js environment or build process on the production server.
-   **Image Uploads:** The backend has an endpoint () that accepts multipart/form-data, saves the file to , and serves it statically. The frontend returns the public URL () to be saved in the database.
-   **Data Management:** The admin panel is fully integrated with the backend to provide CRUD operations for all database collections. A  in React fetches all necessary data on load.
-   **CSV Export:** The submissions manager in the admin panel allows exporting leads to a CSV file, handled client-side in .

**key DB schema**
-   **products:** , , , , ,  (boolean),  (object: ).
-   **site_settings:** A singleton document now includes fields for  links (Facebook, Instagram etc.) and .
-   **bulk_order_submissions:** 
-   **newsletter_submissions:** 

**changes in tech stack**
-   The project's dependency management was switched from yarn install v1.22.22

npm@10.8.2 /usr/lib/node_modules/npm to resolve deployment issues.
-   The deployment strategy was changed to use a pre-built frontend instead of building on the server.

**All files of reference**
-   **/app/backend/server.py**: Contains all backend logic, including new endpoints for submissions and image uploads, and updated data models.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/admin/SubmissionsManager.jsx**: New admin component for viewing and exporting form submissions.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/admin/ProductsManager.jsx**: Heavily modified to support image uploads and custom price variants.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/admin/SettingsManager.jsx**: Heavily modified to support new configurable fields (social links, career email).
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/BulkOrder.jsx**: New page with a contact form that saves to the database.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/Career.jsx**: New page, simplified to direct applicants to an email address managed in the admin panel.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/AboutUs.jsx**: New static content page.
-   **/app/frontend/public/index.html**: Updated with new title and favicon link.
-   **/app/MANUAL_DEPLOYMENT.md**: The primary guide for user deployment.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   None. The agent has actively refactored hardcoded values into configurable settings throughout the session.

**key api endpoints**
-   : (GET, PUT) Manages all global site configuration.
-   : (GET, POST)
-   : (PUT, DELETE)
-   : (GET, POST) For managing bulk order leads.
-   : (GET, POST) For managing newsletter subscribers.
-   : (POST) For uploading files.
-   : (GET) Static endpoint to serve uploaded images.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Use Pre-built Frontend:** After making any changes to the frontend code in , you **must** run  to regenerate the static files in . The application is set up to serve these pre-built files, not to run a live development server in production.
-   **Admin Panel is Key:** The application is highly configurable. Before hardcoding any value, check if it can be added as a field in the  page.
-   **Deployment:** The user has had significant trouble with Docker-based deployment on Hostinger. All Docker files were removed from the project at the user's request. Refer to  for the current deployment strategy. Be prepared for further deployment-related questions.
